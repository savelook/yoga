How to Host a Fab GALentine's Day Party for Glowing Skin
 “I rarely get facials because I have super sensitive skin and I’m quite picky about what product is used on my face. I had heard about this place in Hollywood that was good, so I decided to give it a try. I loved the products they used on me SO much that I kept asking the esthetician... ‘omg what are you using? It smells and feels AHHHHMAZINGGGGG!!!’ I legit left with every product she used in a tote. The brand was IMAGE Skincare and I’ve been an organic fan ever since!”

How to Host a Fab Galentine's Day Party for Glowing Skin

Not that you ever need to impress your friends (they’re already thoroughly impressed obviously), but my skin-focused Galentine’s Day plan will leave your closest companions truly amazed! Every guy and gal deserves fresh, luminous skin on this day, which celebrates love and friendship and connection—the one thing that’s more glow-giving than our special skincare routine below. Whether you’re quarantining with a pod or roommates or preparing a Zoom party, read on for our tips and product recommendations for the best self-care day ever!

Get Comfy

Period. If that means a t-shirt nightgown or a silk robe, go for it! This day is all about being pampered and celebrated—so break out those fuzzy slippers stat!

Prepare Bite-Size Treats and a Skin-Loving Mocktail

Whether you love pita and hummus or cookies and mini-muffins, this day is all about doing things that make you happy and feel good. Whatever you decide, place them on serving platters with colorful napkins so it really feels like you’re treating yourself—even if you’re going to be home alone and Skyping into the party.

To accompany your spread, blend this simple and delicious smoothie mocktail to flood your skin with collagen, vitamin C and protective antioxidants.

CUPID’S KISS: YANA No Wrinkle Watermelon Mocktail

¼ watermelon (seedless or seeds removed)
2 oranges
1 lime
¼ cup strawberries
2 ½ cups of ice
¼ cup mint leaves
1 Image Skincare YANA Collagen Shot

Exfoliate Like a Facialist

Since you can’t get your facialist to come over (unless she happens to be your roommate), DIY it! Get your friends to create a smooth, flawless canvas with a gentle exfoliator. A good polishing will slough of dulling dead skin cells and also help skin soak in all the juicy skincare treatments to follow. Try ILUMA intense brightening exfoliating powder, a water-activated, micro-exfoliating powder that gently buffs away dead skin cells to brighten and illuminate the skin.

Get Chatty With a Mask On

You can’t possibly host a Galentine’s Day without a good old fashioned mask session (the fun kind of mask!). Given our daily use of protective mask coverings causing all sorts of skin irritation and “maskne,” this is an especially much-needed treat (because everyone can use a bit of hydration and a nutrient boost to boot). Try VITAL C hydrating enzyme mask, which rejuvenates the skin and removes visible signs of dullness and dryness, or for a more snap-worthy experience, get your hands on I MASK hydrating hydrogel sheet mask to instantly quench your skin with mineral-rich Onsen-Sui and JeJu waters that leave the skin feeling plump and dewy.

Amplify Your Newfound Glow

Once the masks come off and pure complexion brilliance is revealed, slather on some delicious citrusy goodness—and a whopping dose of age-defying, glow-giving vitamin C! VITAL C hydrating anti-aging serum features an ultra-effective form of vitamin C to brighten, tighten and fights the visible signs of stress and fatigue that commonly appear in aging skin.

Pucker Up

Brush on ORMEDIC Sheer Pink Lip Enhancement Complex to instantly replenish and hydrate lips and make them look naturally full! Don’t worry if you want another treat or beverage—this gloss stays put and honestly, you’ll want to keep applying because it feels oh-so silky!

Hand Out Goodie Bags!

Whether you want to surprise your gals with a pre-Galentine’s package or pass them out after a quarantine get-together, gifts your friends with Four Star Favorites so they can keep their revitalizing skin going at home! This travel-size kit contains our year-round best-sellers ORMEDIC balancing facial cleanser, VITAL C hydrating anti-aging serum, VITAL C hydrating repair crème and PREVENTION+ daily matte moisturizer SPF 32, the full package!
