Whether you’re Zooming your besties, cozying up with your live-in partner or simply celebrating the glory that is your awesome solo self, a head-to-toe revitalization is the perfect way to spend this Valentine’s Day. Our skincare experts have developed a comprehensive ritual so you can indulge yourself. Call it Self-Care Spa Sunday—all in the name of love! Chocolates and flowers: optional.


Step One: Cleanse Your Face

Like all good skincare routines, this V-Day refresh begins with a thorough (but gentle) facial cleanse. Step into the shower and try our ORMEDIC balancing facial cleanser, a mild, refreshing gel cleanser that foams away grime, leaving the skin feeling soft, hydrated and clean with a nourishing complex featuring organic aloe vera and botanical extracts that work with even the most delicate skin. Rub in circular motions and pat to dry!

 
Step Two: Exfoliate Your Face

Next up is a polish—so your complexion can go from rough to smooth (and prepped to absorb all the nourishing treats to follow)! You can trust our ILUMA intense brightening exfoliating powder to do the job. It’s a water-activated, micro-exfoliating cleansing powder that gently that polishes and helps to buffs away radiance-impairing dead skin cells to aid in brightening and illuminating the skin.

 
Step Three: Exfoliate Your Body

After you get your face clean, work on your body! Use our BODY SPA exfoliating body scrub, a dual-action body polish that helps revives dull, dry and flaky skin with both chemical and physical exfoliators to loosen and help buff away dry skin cells.
 

Step Four: Apply a Mask

Next, step out of the shower and into your fanciest robe. With your hair pulled away from your face with a towel or headband, apply our I MASK hydrating hydrogel sheet mask to deliver instant hydration to your skin. Cooling and soothing, this state-of-the-art mask helps to refreshes and revives thirsty skin with mineral-rich waters and hyaluronic acid, while a blend of amino acids, aloe vera and antioxidant extracts promote leave skin radiant and glowing skin.
 

Step Five: Apply Lotion All Over Your Body

While you wait for the sheet mask to get your skin to its utmost luminous, slather on the BODY SPA rejuvenating body lotion, which features a blend of peptides, glycolic acid and retinol to help exfoliate dead skin, rejuvenate skin texture and reduce the appearance of aging. Gentle enough for sensitive skin, it’s also helpful for keratosis pilaris, dry, cracked skin on the feet, or rough elbows and knees!


Step Six: Glow Up With a Powerful Serum

After about ten minutes, remove the sheet mask and massage the additional essence from the mask into your skin. When it’s sufficiently absorbed, layer in our ILUMA intense brightening serum, which offers a calming and brightening solution for irritated, sun-damaged and sensitive skin. A blend of botanical brighteners and vitamin C encourages a clear, even-toned complexion. Radiance to the max!


Step Seven: Apply Eye Cream

Give the windows to your soul some extra TLC by dabbing on ILUMA intense brightening eye crème, a super-hydrating and brightening eye crème that works aggressively to help break up discoloration under the eyes. A blend of phytonutrients, peptides and botanical brightening agents help to reduce visible signs of aging like dark circles, wrinkles, puffiness and lax skin to aid in restoring a firmer, vibrant and more youthful appearance to the eyes.


Step Eight: Contour Gel Crème

After the serum has had time to absorb, massage in a rich layer of the MAX™ contour gel crème, which helps to defy the visible effects of gravity, restoring the look of firmness and volume to the face. Whether you’re facing a mirror, a computer monitor or your special someone in person, you’ll look uplifted, bright and absolutely glowing!


Step Nine: Prime and Perfect the Face

Barefaced is beautiful but so is made up! If you wish to add makeup to your complexion, start with our I PRIME flawless blur gel to create a flawless canvas for makeup application. The silky texture aids in bluring imperfections while also, helping to softening the look appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, skin imperfections and visible signs of aging. (Pssst!

Step 10: Finish Off With a Pink Lip

Doesn’t matter if you’re a romantic or not, you will look amazing in our subtle ORMEDIC sheer pink lip enhancement complex! This sheer pink, ultra-hydrating, polypeptide formula aids in improving the visual volume of lip contours and instantly replenishes and hydrates to help make the lips look naturally full. Plus, a portion of proceeds from every purchase of ORMEDIC sheer pink lip enhancement complex benefits the Care for Skin Foundation, a nonprofit organization that works to improve lives through surgery and skin replacement.
